# DRL-methods
This repo contains the code of classical deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Dependencies
This code requires the following:
* python 3.7.6
* pytorch 1.6.0
* gym & Mujoco

## Experimental Tasks
We implement these classical DRL algorithms in Continuous 2D Navigation Task and some Mujoco control tasks.

## Algorithms
This repo contains:
* Vanilla Policy Gradient
* Natural Policy Gradient
* Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
* Actor-Critic (A2C)
